# ConFront
Fully customizable **CLI for web apps**. 

Think of it as a command line interface of your operating system that you know and love, but inside your web app.

## Description
ConFront is designed to help web app admins save precious time by converting their everyday tasks into simple, easy to remember, **customizable commands**.

These commands can **utilize REST API functions that are already in your app**.

## Demo

https://zorzysty.github.io/confront/demo/

### Example use case
Let's say your web app has an administration page where admin can log in and perform some repeatable tasks. This page contains:
* Clear cache button
* Add user form
* Edit user form
* Backup database form with some checkboxes and datepicker for additional options

All of these call specific functions that send REST requests to the backend using promises. After promise is resolved/rejected proper notification is displayed containing server response.

This is where ConFront comes in. You can perform the same tasks but much quicker and simpler. Just like using terminal in your operating system. Simply open ConFront (`` CTRL+` `` on Win/Linux or `` Control+` `` on mac) and enter your command. For example: 

| Task                                    | Example command                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clear cache                             | `clearcache`                                                    |
| Add user                                | `adduser "John Smith" --group Users`                            |
| Change user permissions and email       | `changeuser 123456 --group Admins --email newemail@example.com` |
| Backup database                         | `db backup`                                                     |
| Backup database (with additional flags) | `db backup -aq --date 2016.11.11`                               |

## Installing
```
npm install confront --save
```

### ES6 Import
```
import ConFront from "confront";
ConFront();
```

### Script src
**It's strongly recommended to use ES6 Import as shown above instead of this**

You can use ConFront by adding script tag to your HTML:
```html
<script src="./node_modules/confront/dist/confront.js"></script>
```
It exposes window.ConFront and you can use it like this:
```javascript
ConFront.default();
```

### CSS
For ConFront to work properly you need to style it with CSS. You can use the default styles:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./node_modules/confront/dist/confront.css">
```

## Getting started

###Basic usage
After you have ConFront running, open your app and simply press `` CTRL+` `` (Windows/Linux) or `` Control+` `` (macOS). This shortcut can be [configured](#Configuration). 

Type in `help` and press Enter/Return to see all the currently available commands.

### Syntax
```
<command_name> [<argument>...] [<flag> [<flag_argument>...]]... 
```

Here's how to read the above:

| Notation                        | Description                                   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `<Text inside angle brackets>`  | Placeholder for which you must supply a value |
| `[Text inside square brackets]` | Optional items                                |
| `Ellipsis (â€¦)`                  | Items that can be repeated                    |

In other words:

1. Name of command (**the only thing required, rest is optional**)
2. Space
3. List of arguments separated by spaces (if argument has a space inside, you can wrap it with double-quotes: `command short_arg "long argument"`)
4. Space
5. List of short (prefixed with `-`) and long (prefixed with `--`) flags separated by spaces. Each flag can have their own list of arguments separated by spaces

NOTICE:
* Short flags can be grouped following one `-` sign without spaces (`-xyz` is equal to `-x -y -z`).
* Arguments are always assigned to the last flag that proceeds them (`command -xyz myarg` means that `myarg` is assigned to `z` flag)

### Custom commands 
ConFront is pretty much useless until you power it up with your custom commands. You can pass commands object as the first argument when calling ConFront.

Let's create a simple command that adds together two given numbers:
```javascript
ConFront({
    "add": {
        cmd: (args) => args[0] + args[1]
    }
});
```
Now when you open up ConFront in your app and type in `add 1 2`, you'll get the result displayed as expected.
```
> add 1 2
3
```
Adding a custom command makes it visible in **help** - a built-in command that lists all the available commands.
Specifying additional `"desc"` key to `add` command will make it display in help:
```javascript
ConFront({
    "add": {
        cmd: (args) => args[0] + args[1],
        desc: "Adds together two numbers"
    }
});
```
```
> help
add:            Adds together two numbers
clear:          Clears console 
clearhistory:   Clears history 
help:           This help
```
### Flags
Let's enhance "add" command a little by adding support for `-a` flag that changes command behaviour so that it sums all the given numbers instead of the first two.
And while we're at it, let's do some code separation for better readability.
```javascript
function add(args, flags) {
    if (flags["a"]) {
        return args.reduce((total, number) => total + number);
    } else {
        return args[0] + args[1];
    }
}
const commands = {
    "add": {
        cmd: (args, flags) => add(args, flags),
        desc: "Adds together two numbers"
    }
};
ConFront(commands);
```
```
> add 1 2 3 4 5 -a
15
```

It also supports long flags, like `--limit`. Also all flags can have their own arguments. Here's the example:
```javascript
function add(args, shortFlags, longFlags) {
    if (shortFlags["a"] || longFlags["all"]) {
        return args.reduce((total, number) => total + number);
    } else if (longFlags["limit"]) {
        return args.slice(0, longFlags["limit"]).reduce((total, number) => total + number);
    } else {
        return args[0] + args[1];
    }
}
const commands = {
    "add": {
        cmd: (args, shortFlags, longFlags) => add(args, shortFlags, longFlags),
        desc: "Adds together two numbers"
    }
};
ConFront(commands);
```
```
> add 1 2 3 4 5 --limit 3
6
> add 1 2 3 4 5 --limit 1
1
> add 1 2 3 4 5 --limit 4
10
```

Short flags can be grouped. For example command:
```
backupdb -azm "My backup" --date 2016.11.11 --log info email 7
```
Will give you this short flags object:
```json
{
    "a": [],
    "z": [],
    "m": ["My backup"]
}
```
And long flags:
```json
{
    "date": ["2016.11.11"],
    "log":  ["info", "email", 7]
}
```

### Promises
ConFront was designed with promises in mind, so you don't have to worry about it. ConFront waits for promise to be resolved or rejected and in the meantime shows a spinner animation. When the promise is fulfilled, it displays the result (if resolved) or error (if rejected).

Example:
```javascript
function promiseme() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(function () {
            resolve(['from resolved promise', "dsadsada", '222', {"aaa": 22, "ss": 4}]);
        }, 2000)
    })
}

function rejectme() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(function () {
            reject("Promise rejected");
        }, 2000)
    })
}

const commands = {
    "promiseme": {
        cmd: () => promiseme(),
        desc: "returns promise (resolved)"
    },
    "rejectme": {
        cmd: () => rejectme(),
        desc: "returns promise (rejected)"
    },
};
ConFront(commands);
```
```
> promiseme
(spinner for two seconds)
[
  "from resolved promise",
  "list item",
  "222",
  {
    "aaa": 22,
    "ss": 4
  }
]
```
```
> rejectme
(spinner for two seconds)
(Error: ) Promise rejected
```

### HTML
Your command can also return HTML which will be displayed inside ConFront. ConFront will try to guess if the returned value is HTML, but you can spare it the work by explicitly setting type to "html". 
It's useful especially when we need to format the outcome, for example built-in `help` command is using html table:
```javascript
const displayHelp = () => {
	const tableStart = "<table class='confront-table'>";
	const tableEnd = "</table>";
	let rows = [];
	Object.keys(tasks).forEach((key) => {
		const name = key;
		const desc = tasks[key].desc;
		rows.push(`<tr><td class="confront-label">${name}: </td><td class="confront-value">${desc ? desc : ""}</td>`);
	});
	return tableStart + rows.sort().join("") + tableEnd;
};
const commands = {
    "help": {
        cmd: () => displayHelp(),
        desc: "Displays this help",
        type: "html",
    },
};
ConFront(commands);
```

## Configuration
Custom configuration can be passed as a second argument to ConFront. Right now it allows to change three basic values. Here's the example:
```javascript
const config = {
    shortcutActivator: "ctrl",
    shortcutKeyCode: 220,
    convertTypes: false,
};
ConFront(commands, config);
```
| Parameter         | Description                                                  | Possible options                        | Default value |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| shortcutActivator | Key to be pressed to activate shortcut                       | "ctrl", "ctrl+shift", "ctrl+alt"        | "ctrl"        |
| shortcutKeyCode   | Code of the key to be pressed when activator enabled         | See [keycode.info](http://keycode.info) | 220           |
| convertTypes      | Automatically convert types from string (number and boolean) | true, false                             | true          |
| welcomeMessage    | Message that is shown at the top when running ConFront       | Any string                              |               |

## Translation
There are some build in strings that can be translated. Custom translation can be passed as a third argument to ConFront:
```javascript
const translation = {
    "err.cmdNotFound": "Custom command not found translation"
};
ConFront(commands, config, translation);
```
Here are all the default values:
```json
{
	"desc.clear": "Clears console",
	"desc.clearHistory": "Clears history",
	"desc.help": "This help",
	"err.cmdNotFound": "Command not found",
	"historyCleared": "History cleared"
}
```
